<br><br>

- :school: I am a `Student` at Faculty of sciencie basic and enginner at [Universidad Autonoma de Occidente](https://www.uao.edu.co). I am a beginner in Python, but I have learned to work with libraries such as pandas and numpy, which are essential for data analysis and manipulation. Additionally, I have familiarity with the syntax and basic handling of Java, enabling me to work on entry-level programming tasks in this language. My expertise also includes database management, where I am proficient in working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, specifically MySQL Workbench and MongoDB. My skill set reflects a solid foundation in programming and data management, which I continuously strive to expand and refine.
